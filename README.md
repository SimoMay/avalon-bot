To start the server:

```
deno run --allow-env --allow-read --allow-net index.js
```

Deploy and add the app to your Slack workspace/channel

## Usage

### Start a game of Avalon

Simply go to the channel and type:

```
/avalon @player1 @player2 @player3...
```

Each player will receive a direct message letting them know which character
theyâ€™ll be playing, an image, also will mention any extra information the player
need to know. (Special powers, etc)

In the channel, the bot will mention the players, how many players are in the
game, good vs evil ratio, and who is the king/leader for the first round.

### Overiding the default setup

The bot will use the default/recommended setup for the game mentioned in the
link here: https://theresistanceavalon.com/rules

#### Here is how to force certain characters to be in the game:

Example:

```
/avalon morgana +ob @player1 @player2 @player3...
```

The names of the characters can be at the beginning of the command,
and can also be after the player names.

List of characters that can be forced:

- Percival: `percival` or `+p` or `+pr`
- Oberon: `oberon` or `+o` or `+ob`
- Mordred: `mordred` or `+md` or `+mrd`
- Morgana: `morgana` or `+mg` or `+mrg` (Percival will be added to the game)
- To play with no special characters: `basic` or `no special` or `--` (Merlin
  and Assassin will still be in the game)

## Happy playing!
